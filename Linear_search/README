Linear search is a simple search algorithm that searches for a given element in an array or list by sequentially checking each element in the list until a match is found or the end of the list is reached.

In the code above, we define a method named linearSearch that takes an array arr and a key key as input parameters. The method then iterates through the array using a for loop and checks if the current element is equal to the key. If a match is found, the method returns the index of the element in the array. If the key is not found in the array, the method returns -1.

In the main method, we define an array arr with some sample data and a key key that we want to search for. We then call the linearSearch method and store the result in a variable named index. Finally, we print out whether the key was found or not by checking if the value of index is -1 or not.
