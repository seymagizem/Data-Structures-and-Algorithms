In this implementation, we define a Stack class that has a maximum size and an array to hold the elements of the stack. The top variable keeps track of the index of the top element of the stack. The push() method adds an element to the top of the stack by incrementing the top variable and setting the value of the new top element to the input value. The pop() method removes and returns the element at the top of the stack by decrementing the top variable and returning the value of the element. The peek() method returns the value of the element at the top of the stack without removing it. The isEmpty() method returns true if the stack is empty (i.e., if top is equal to -1), and false otherwise. The isFull() method returns true if the stack is full (i.e., if top is equal to maxSize -1), and false otherwise.
