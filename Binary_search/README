Binary Search is a searching algorithm that searches an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the array into half. 

Here's how it works:
1- Set start and end variables to the first and last indices of the array, respectively.
2- Calculate the middle index of the array by adding start and end and dividing the sum by 2.
3- If the element to be searched is equal to the element at the middle index, return the middle index.
4- If the element to be searched is less than the element at the middle index, set end variable to middle - 1.
5- If the element to be searched is greater than the element at the middle index, set start variable to middle + 1.
6- Repeat the above steps until the element is found or the start index becomes greater than the end index.
