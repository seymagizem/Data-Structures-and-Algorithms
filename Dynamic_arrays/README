In Java, dynamic arrays are implemented using the ArrayList class, which is part of the Java collections framework.

A dynamic array is an array-like data structure with a variable size that can grow or shrink as needed during runtime. It provides more flexibility than a static array, which has a fixed size that cannot be changed once it is initialized.

The ArrayList class in Java provides dynamic array functionality by dynamically resizing the internal array as elements are added or removed. When the array needs to be resized, the ArrayList class creates a new, larger array and copies the existing elements into the new array.

Here are some key features of ArrayList in Java:
 > ArrayList is a generic class, which means it can store elements of any data type.
 > ArrayList is implemented using an underlying array, which is automatically resized as elements are added or removed.
 > ArrayList provides methods to add, remove, get and set elements at any index in the array.
 > ArrayList is not thread-safe, which means it should not be used in concurrent environments without proper synchronization.
