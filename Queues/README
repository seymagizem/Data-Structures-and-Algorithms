This implementation uses an array to store the elements of the queue, and uses two pointers front and rear to keep track of the front and rear of the queue respectively. The enqueue method adds an element to the rear of the queue, and the dequeue method removes an element from the front of the queue. The peek method returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it. The isEmpty, isFull, and size methods provide information about the state of the queue.
